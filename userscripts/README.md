# About Auto Login Scripts
`auto-login-*` scripts will automate parts of the login flow, but you'll still
need to provide your own username, passwords, and 2FA method (OTP/Yubikey).

Some of these scripts require you to supply your username so it can pattern match.
Do not modify the script to store passwords as, sure, they're local memory,
but then you'll have to deal with encryption and such. Use 1Password or another password
manager.


# Installing
1. Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
2. Find the script you want
3. Click `Raw`
4. The Violentmonkey UI should pop up to ask if you want to install it

The scripts auto update once a day by default (config in Violentmonkey)
